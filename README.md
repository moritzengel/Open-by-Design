# Open-by-Design
This GitHub repository is the outcome of the thesis Open by Design – The Limits of Translating Bits to Atoms by Moritz Engel at ECAL, which investigates Open Source in Product Design. The repository hosts the essay and compiles the research in the form of research cards. The goal is to make these cards open for contribution.

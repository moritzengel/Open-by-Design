# How to Contribute

## The Goal
The research for *Open by Design* is being open-sourced on GitHub. The GitHub project page is meant to be a living, growing database contributed to through the "Research Card" format. You can also contribute to the physical publication by filling out the blank research cards provided in the folder. 

The ultimate goal of this open-source approach is to ensure this research is expanded, remains transparent, becomes more diverse, and stays up-to-date far longer than a traditional static thesis.

## 3 Ways to Contribute a Research Card

The contribution process is designed to be as open and accessible as possible. Choose the method that works best for you:

### Option 1: The Markdown Way (For GitHub Users)
If you are comfortable with GitHub, you can add a new digital research card directly to the repository using our Markdown template.

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Navigate to the `Research_Cards_with_contributions` folder.
3. Create a new `.md` file named after your product (e.g., `fairphone.md`).
4. Copy the layout from  `card-template.md` and fill in the details.
5. Add any images to the `images` folder and link them in your file.
6. Submit a **Pull Request** to add your card to the main database.

### Option 2: The InDesign Way (For Designers)
If you prefer working with professional layout tools, we provide the original Adobe InDesign template used for the publication.

1. Download the **InDesign Template** (`.indd`) located in the repository's `templates` folder.
2. Fill out the text fields and drop your high-resolution images or vector drawings into the layout.
3. Export your finished card as a **PDF**.
4. You can submit this by opening an **Issue** on GitHub and attaching your PDF, or by emailing it to [me@moritzengel.xyz].

### Option 3: The Analog Way (By Hand)
You do not need to be a developer or a digital designer to contribute! If you are holding the physical publication, you will find blank research cards inside the folder. 

1. **Take a blank card** from the physical folder (or print the `Research_Card_empty.pdf` from this repository).
2. **Fill it out by hand**. You can write the description, note the sources, and even sketch the product directly in the image box.
3. **Digitize it:** Take a clear photograph or scan your finished card.
4. **Share it:** Upload the image to our GitHub via an **Issue**, or email it directly to [me@moritzengel.xyz] so we can digitize it and add it to the main repository.

### What makes a good Research Card?
When adding a new product, platform, or project, keep the following in mind:
* **Relevance:** Does the product attempt to solve or highlight the "Replication Barrier"?
* **Clarity:** Keep descriptions concise. Focus on *how* the product handles openness, repairability, or full ownership.
* **Sources:** Always provide a link or reference so others can verify and explore the project themselves.

Thank you for helping us build a more open and understandable physical world!

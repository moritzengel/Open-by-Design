# Open by Design: Open Binder

Welcome to the open-source hardware repository for the **Modular Shelf Binding**. 

This project is a physical manifestation of the *Open by Design* thesis. It is a hybrid folder and shelf combination designed to hold a scrapbook (via a top ring binding) while providing individual, stacked shelves for an abstract, a printed essay, and empty research cards. 

By making this design open-source, the goal is to provide a functional, repairable, and adaptable binding system that anyone can manufacture at home or in a local FabLab.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

To build this binding, you will need a mix of standard off-the-shelf hardware and custom-manufactured parts. 

### Standard Hardware (To Buy)
* **4x** M3 x 8mm screws 
* **4x** M1.2 x 6mm screws

### Manufactured Parts (To Make)
**CNC Cut or 3D Printed:**
* **1x Front Panel:** Can be CNC milled from 2mm Aluminum (recommended for stability and aesthetics) or 3D printed out of PLA/PETG.

**3D Printed (e.g., in Black PLA/PETG):**
* **1x** Spacer no. 1
* **1x** Shelfboard no. 1
* **1x** Shelfboard no. 2
* **1x** Bottom Shelfboard no. 3.1
* **1x** Bottom Shelfboard no. 3.2

## Assembly Instructions

![Exploded View of the Modular Binding](/path-to-your-image/bom-exploded-view.jpg)

### Step 1: Prepare the Parts
Ensure all 3D printed parts are clean and free of support material. If you CNC-milled the aluminum front panel, lightly sand the edges to remove any sharp burrs.

### Step 2: Assemble the Bottom Base
Print **Bottom Shelfboard no. 3.1** and **Bottom Shelfboard no. 3.2** so the outsidefacing surfaces are on the printbed and then glue the two parts together with superglue. 

### Step 3: Secure the Rings 
Use the **M1.2 x 6mm screws** to fasten the **2x Binding Rings** that are pushed through the frontpanel after inserting standart printed DIN A5 pages.

### Step 4: Stack the Shelves
Begin stacking the internal structure. Place **Shelfboard no. 2** over the base, followed by **Shelfboard no. 1**, using the **Spacer no. 1** to maintain the correct gaps for your documents. 

### Step 5: Attach the Front Panel
Align your 2mm Aluminum (or 3D printed) **Front Panel** with the mounting holes on the assembled shelf structure. Use the **M3 x 8mm screws** to secure the panel to the 3D-printed body.

## How to Modify
Because this is an "Open by Design" object, you are encouraged to adapt it! 
* Need more shelves? You can print additional spacers and shelfboards.
* Using a different paper size? Modify the step or fusion 360 files to widen the shelf base.

If you make a cool modification, please share it back to this repository via a Pull Request!

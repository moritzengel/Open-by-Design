# Abstract

While the Open Source philosophy has become a substantial part of the world's digital infrastructure, physical products remain largely closed and proprietary. This research investigates the economic frictions that prevent the model from translating successfully from software ("bits") to physical products ("atoms"). Through analysis of projects, definitions and history, this memoire identifies a "Replication Barrier": the financial, communications, and infrastructural hurdles that often make strict Open Source Products financially unsustainable. This thesis also critiques the resulting phenomenon of "Openwashing" and the economic challenges of a fully open project, which often results in open innovation fueling closed competitors.

This memoire finally argues against the rigid binary definitions of "Open" versus "Closed." Instead, it proposes a model that disconnects commercial replication and usage rights from access to knowledge. The goal should be full product ownership while collaborative development remains non-commercial. Making projects financially viable while empowering the "Right to Repair," adaptation and independence from companies. This approach is a vital step toward a circular economy, moving the industry away from "black box" consumerism towards objects that are understandable, repairable, and lasting.
